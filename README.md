# DevOps 101

The objective of the `DevOps 101` is to explain how you can create a CICD Pipeline on IBM Cloud in order to automate full life cycle management of your application.

`IBM Cloud Continuous Delivery` service includes toolchains that support development, deployment and operations tasks to manage your CICD.

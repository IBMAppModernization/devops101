# DevOps 101

The objective of the `DevOps 101` is to explain how you can create a CI/CD Pipeline on IBM Cloud in order to automate full life cycle management of your application.

`IBM Cloud Continuous Delivery` service includes toolchains that support development, deployment and operations tasks to manage your CI/CD.

The accronym CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. Continuous Integration (CI) stands for the practice of developers merging their work into a shared main branch, validating the merger by creating a automatic build and automatic testing against the build. Continuous Delivery (CD) adds an automated release process to deploy an application.
